_Migration guide_

This release should only affect you in the following cases:

1. You were relying on the keys returned by `#.mergeEdge`, `#.updateEdge` etc. In which case those methods now return a useful tuple containing said key as its first element as well as additional information about whether target elements already existed in the graph or not.
2. Some hidden adjacency iteration methods were mangled and are still hidden. This could only affect you if you were using `#.forEach`, `#.find` or `#.adjacency` (not to be confused with their node, edge & neighbor counterparts).

## 0.22.2

- Fixing `#.mergeEdge` & `#.updateEdge` error messages.
- Improving performance of `#.addEdge` etc. (less deopt).

## 0.22.0

- Adding `#.mapEdges`, `#.filterEdges`, `#.reduceEdges`, `#.findEdge` `#.someEdge`, `#.everyEdge`.

_Migration guide_

This release should only affect you in the following use-cases:

1. You were using `#.forEach*Until` methods, in which case you should replace them by the relevant `#.find*` or `#.some*` method.
2. You were using the boolean second argument to the `#.degree` methods. Replace those calls by `#.degreeWithoutSelfLoops`.
3. You were using the (well-hidden) two-arguments polymorphism of `#.neighbors`. Replace those calls by `#.areNeighbors`.
4. You were using iterators in which case the yielded entries are now objects rather than arrays and should be easier to destructure to access the parts you need.
5. You were doing despicable things with automatically generated keys.
